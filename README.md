This repo will be a multiuser cloud version containing the three services currently planned:

[p2pay-invoicing](https://github.com/p2payserver/p2pay-invoicing)  
[p2pay-ecommerce](https://github.com/p2payserver/p2pay-ecommerce)  
[p2pay-booking](https://github.com/p2payserver/p2pay-booking)  

The installation will be very easy with a deployment from the repo on platforms such as Digita Ocean or Vercel, without a databsase needed.
